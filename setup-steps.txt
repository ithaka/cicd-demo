# Requirements -
# 40gb free space
# homebrew installed
# fork repo (https://github.com/ithaka/cicd-demo), then clone and-
cd cicd-demo

# Install kubectl -
brew install kubectl kubernetes-helm
# other oses : https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
#              https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm

# Install minikube and virtualbox -
brew cask install minikube virtualbox
# others oses: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases
#              https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

# if you already had minikube installed with other settings - minikube stop && minikube delete && rm -rf ~/.minikube
minikube config set disk-size 40000MB

# start the cluster. This takes some time,  2-3 minutes
minikube start

# now your cluster should be running
eval $(minikube docker-env)
minikube status
minikube dashboard

### do the above asap!!!! ###

# Add admin privileges to default role (not recommended in real life) -
kubectl create clusterrolebinding kube-system-default-superadmin \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --serviceaccount=default:default

# Initialize helm
helm init --service-account default --tiller-namespace default
export TILLER_NAMESPACE="default"

# should see tiller pod now
kubectl get pods

# Install jenkins using a helm chart
helm repo update
helm install --name jenkins stable/jenkins --values jenkins/values.yaml
# you can ignore most of the message that helm prints after this,


# You may need to delete pod (not deployment) once
# if the dashboard shows 'pod has unbound PersistentVolumeClaims'

# Get the url for jenkins. Username and password is admin. It might take a minute or two for
# Jenkins to initialize and for the service to be ready.
minikube service jenkins --url

## IN JENKINS ##
# The following screenshots can be found the screenshots directory of this project

# screenshot 1 : you should see the login screen once you visit the url from the command above.
# Log in with UN: admin and PW: admin

# screenshot 2 : After logging in, you'll be presented with the Jenkins home screen.
# We'll want to change two settings in the main Jenkins settings,
# so click 'manage jenkins' then 'configure system'

# screenshot 2a : Set the number of executors to something higher than 0, so Jenkins jobs can run. (why isn't that the default?)

# screenshot 2b & 2c : In the Github Pull Request Builder section, click add to add a credential. It will be a 'secret text'
# type credential. This needs to be a github personal access token. Instructions for creating this are in the 'talk' directory
# of this project. Hold on to this token, we'll need it again for a later step and you can't retrieve it from Github

# screenshot 3 : This screen is what you see when you click 'create new job' (or 'new item' from the menu on the left)
# back on the front page of Jenkins. On this screen, you'll want to enter a name for your job, then select
# multibranch pipeline (not pipeline or multi-configuration project) and hit ok. This will bring you
# to the configuration for this pipeline.

# screenshot 4a & b : We need to set up a couple things in this configuration section. First click 'add source'
# and choose 'github'.  We're going to add credentials again, this time a username and password. The
# username will be your github username and the password will be the personal access token from step 2c

# screenshot 4c : set the owner field to be your github username and the repository to be your forked
# version of this repo. Also set the 'discover branches' strategy to be all branches.

# screenshot 5 : Once you apply and save, you will be brought back to the main page for the job you created.
# Jenkins should have indexed your branches and found that the master branch has a Jenkinsfile.
# It should start running the pipeline in that branch. In the lower left of the screen (you might have to scroll
# down) you should see a jenkins slave has started and is starting to run your job.

# screenshot 6 : this is the console output of your running job. You can get here by clicking on the '#1' next to
# the running job mentioned in the previous step, then clicking console output.
# the output should eventually stop to wait for your input on this screen before continuing.

# from here, you're on your own the explore, expand and see how this can help you automate your
# own actual workflows. Good luck, and we're happy to help to the extent that we can.
